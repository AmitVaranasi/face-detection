# face-detection
A face detection using convolutional neural network
In this project I have first took the images reshaped them and then numbered it as 1 and 0 if the person is s1 and if the person is s2.
Then stored them in a file and feed to my neural network, my network consists of two sets of convolutional , activation and maxpooling layers ,then a dense layer with 64 units and finally a dense layer and activation with softmax classifier.
